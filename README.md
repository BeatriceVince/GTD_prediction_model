Global Terrorism Dataset for model prediction learning

GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group.

Use some features to build a model that can predict what group may have been responsible for an incident.
